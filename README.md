# Arnold-s-Cat-Map---C-implementation

Arnold's Cat Map: Entropy and Pixel Correlation Analysis (C Implementation) This project implements Arnold's Cat Map in C, a chaotic transformation used in image processing. It explores entropy and pixel correlation changes to analyze the transformation's effect on image randomness and structure. Includes detailed comments and examples for educational purposes.
